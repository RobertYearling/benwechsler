            <p>“If you advance confidently in the direction of your dreams, and endeavor to live the life you imagined, you will meet with a success unexpected in common hours. You will pass an invisible boundary.</p>
            <p>New, universal and more liberal laws will begin to establish themselves around and within you, and you will live with the license of a higher order of beings.</p>

            <p>If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost; that is where they should be.
            Now put the foundations under them.”</p>

        <h2>Knowledge Through Awareness & Creativity</h2>
        <p>Benjamin Wechsler has over 25 years of professional experience in education, technology sales and consulting, arts administration, web design, CRM consulting, knowledge management, and online communications consulting. Through his work with public schools and colleges as a teacher, then consulting with large school districts and teachers in the implementation of technology, Mr. Wechsler began to formulate a process that continually resulted in success with his clients and students. This process was more refined as he worked in the traditional corporate culture as a CRM and online communications strategist. In 2004, Mr. Wechsler attained certification in knowledge management. In order to more effectively achieve his own personal and professional goals, Benjamin Wechsler, Inc. was formed.</p>

        <p>Blending all of his professional and educational experience, Benjamin Wechsler, Inc. is the result of applying Wechsler’s process to his own life. “Knowledge through awareness & creativity” is not only a tag line, but is the mantra of Wechsler’s work with his clients. The process is molded to the specific situation with each client, but through a series of processes, the client is led to discover answers, or required “knowledge,” within his own organization. In Wechsler’s case, his life’s experiences were the source. Wechsler serves as a coach, or as many label him, a decoder of what is already in front of the clients’ eyes. The process is innovating and empowering in all cases.</p>

                <p class="aboutBlock_text">
                    I am the son of Betty Pemberton and William Wechsler. I was named  Benjamin Frederick Wechsler, after my two uncles, Benjamin Wechsler, who died in World War II, and Frederick Pemberton. As my mother told the story, upon my birth, my father’s family was so proud to have another Benjamin in the family. My mother was admant. “He will never be called Benjamin. He shall be called Ben, period!” Hence, my logo, is a tribute to the strong woman she was and remains in my heart.
